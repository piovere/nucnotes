\problem{3.5}
    Propose a three-level cascade where when one level rejects, the next one is used as in equation 3.10. How can we fix the $\lambda$ on different levels? 

    \begin{equation}
        \lambda_{ik} =
        \begin{cases}
        0 & i = k \\
        \lambda & i = K + 1 \\
        1 & otherwise

    \end{cases}
    \end{equation}

\solution
    

\problem{3.9}
    Show that as we move an item from the consequent to the antecedent, confidence can never increase: confidence(ABC → D) ≥ confidence(AB → CD).

\solution
    

\problem{3.10}
    Associated with each item sold in basket analysis, if we also have a number indicating how much the customer enjoyed the product, for example, on a scale of 0 to 10, how can you use this extra information to calculate which item to propose to a customer?

\solution
