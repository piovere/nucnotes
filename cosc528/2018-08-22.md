# Course Introduction

- Expected workload: 6 hours per week (outside of class)
- Mostly not pre-packaged ML libraries, don't have to program non-ML (numpy?)
    - e.g. matrix manipulations, plotting, data wrangling
    - may choose to compare results to off-the-shelf
        - but this is unrealistic, so this may not match the real world
- Languages: Python, Matlab/Octave (C++ and java are OK)
