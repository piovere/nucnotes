\problem{}
For a total cross section given by the equation $$\sigma_t(E) = 5 + 0.5E - 0.1 E^2, E\texttt{ in \si{\kilo\electronvolt}}$$ find the total group cross section for a group that spans from \SIrange{2}{3}{\kilo\electronvolt}.

\solution


\problem{}
Find the isotropic elastic scatter cross section for Carbon-12 (A=12) from an energy group that spans from \SIrange{0.6}{0.7}{\kilo\electronvolt} to a group that spans from \SIrange{0.4}{0.5}{\kilo\electronvolt}. Assume the flux spectrum is $1/E$ and that the scattering cross section is a constant \SI{5}{\barn}.

\solution

\problem{}
For the same physical situation as in the previous problem, find the within-group scattering cross sectios for the energy group that spans from \SIrange{0.6}{0.7}{\kilo\electronvolt}.
