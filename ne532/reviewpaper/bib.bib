abstract="The intrinsic consistency and discrete character of high resolution gamma spectrometric measurements are used in order to make self-calibration of these measurements. Both energy and overall relative efficiency (including all geometrical self-attenuation and attenuation factors as well as the detector efficiency) can be performed using the same measured spectrum. The method is particularly useful for non-destructive gamma spectrometric measurements of isotopic ratios on different nuclear material samples. As an illustration, a complete isotopic analysis of U/Pu mixed oxide rods is given. The accuracy of the isotopic measurements depends strongly on the accuracy of the available nuclear data and comparison with destructive analysis when possible facilitates the process of obtaining more accurate nuclear data for the isotopes involved. The attainable accuracy is estimated to be better than 0.5{\%} for239Pu and241Pu measurements.",
